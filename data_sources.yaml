# Data Source Configuration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines all the data sources (databases, APIs) that the AI
# agent can connect to.
#
# For each data source, you must provide:
#   - name: A unique identifier for the agent to use.
#   - type: The kind of data source. Supported types are 'postgres' and 'openapi'.
#   - description: A clear, natural language description that helps the AI
#                  decide when to use this source.
#
# Additional fields depend on the type:
#   - For 'postgres': The system will look for environment variables prefixed
#     with the source's name (e.g., SALES_DB_HOST for a source named 'sales_db').
#   - For 'openapi': You must provide the 'spec_url' (the URL to the
#     openapi.json file) and the 'base_url' for making API calls.
